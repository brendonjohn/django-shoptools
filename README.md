Reusable apps for cart and checkout functionality. These are intended to be used
as a base and hacked on, per project.  

Currently there are various feature branches (i.e. vouchers, accounts) -
theoretically, you should be able to merge the branches you want into your
checkout to get those features. Realistically however, master will probably
just end up tracking the last project and will include all the different
features.
