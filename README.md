Reusable apps for cart and checkout functionality. These are intended to be used
as a base and hacked on, per project.  

Currently there are various feature branches (i.e. vouchers, accounts) -
theoretically, you should be able to merge the branches you want into your
checkout to get those features. When hacking on this repo, try to keep things
separated in this way as much as possible.
